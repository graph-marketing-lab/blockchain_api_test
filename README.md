# blockchain_api_test

As an alternative to Opensea API, we tested API provided by Alchemy API and NFTPort.
Sample code extracts all NFTs associated with a wallet.
You need to sign up for free on Alchemy (https://www.alchemy.com/) or on NFTPort (https://www.nftport.xyz/) and insert your API key in the code.
